# üå™Ô∏è Tornado Damage Dashboard

An interactive web dashboard visualizing tornado events across the United States in 2023.

üîó **Live App**: [https://tornado-damage-dashboard.onrender.com/](https://tornado-damage-dashboard.onrender.com/)

---

## üìä Project Overview and Purpose

As global warming becomes an increasingly looming threat, severe weather events are on the rise. To identify areas in the country where tornadoes are more frequent and more damaging, we created a website that shows various charts and maps of tornado data in the United States from 2023. This project uses real-world geospatial data, Flask, and Leaflet.js to provide interactive visualizations.

---

## üß≠ How to Use the Site

Users can access our main homepage and select from the following three interactive visualizations:

- **Heatmap** of tornado damage intensity by location
- **Bubble Map** representing tornado magnitude
- **Line Chart** of tornado counts by day/month

Each page includes a month filter to help narrow down results.

> The site is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly with no instructions needed.
